# C++ Project

This C++ project involves the development of a program to enable the Arduino Factory to control the production of Arduino boards (fictitious).

## Project Objectives
The tasks include manipulating the data structure offered by the C++ <vector> class. The specific objectives are as follows:
- Inserting elements into the vector.
- Modifying elements within the vector.
- Deleting elements from the vector.
- Querying elements in the vector.

Additionally, the project involves using a struct to define the structure of each element in the vector. The combination of a struct (or class) with vectors or arrays allows for the storage of different data types.

## Program Features
1. **Insert Production Order:** Add a new production order to the vector.
2. **Query Arduino Production:** Retrieve information about the production of a specific Arduino.
3. **Delete Production Order:** Remove a production order from the vector.

## User Interface
The main program should implement a console-based menu, allowing the user to interact with the functions mentioned above.
